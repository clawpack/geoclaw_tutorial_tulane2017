# geoclaw_tutorial_tulane2017
Resources for a GeoClaw tutorial at Tulane University in April, 2017, as part of the
[Clifford Lectures Conference](http://www2.tulane.edu/sse/math/news/clifford-lectures-april-2017.cfm).

### Installing Clawpack/GeoClaw

See [the installation instructions](http://www.clawpack.org/installing.html).  Note that several 
[other software packages](http://www.clawpack.org/prereqs.html#prereqs) are also required.

### Using Docker

In this directory you will find a Dockerfile that makes it easy to install Clawpack 
and all the dependencies needed within a virtual machine, once you have 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. 

See the file `Dockerfile.md` for instructions.

See also 
[Docker for Clawpack](http://www.clawpack.org/docker_image.html#docker-image).

### Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains some notebooks that will be used to guide the tutorial.

Github renders notebooks, except that the animations will not be displayed. 
To see the notebooks with the animations intact, you can view them using 
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) at the links below:
